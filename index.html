                <p>
                    Link, a young hero, is tasked by the Great Deku Tree to stop the evil Gerudo king, Ganondorf, from obtaining the Triforce. With Princess Zelda’s guidance, Link gathers three Spiritual Stones but is tricked into opening the Sacred Realm, allowing Ganondorf to seize power. Sealed away for seven years, Link awakens as an adult and, with the help of the seven sages, frees Hyrule from Ganondorf’s grasp. After an epic battle, Ganondorf is sealed away, and Zelda sends Link back to his childhood to prevent the events from unfolding.                </p>
